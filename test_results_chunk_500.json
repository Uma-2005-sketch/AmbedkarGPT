In both texts, he highlights that the untouchables were denied access to education, which was a significant factor in their subjugation. However, in Document 6, Ambedkar's views on education expand beyond just the right to education, suggesting that the real issue lies not only in the denial of education but also in the belief in the sanctity of the shastras (ancient Hindu scriptures) that justify and perpetuate this denial. He advocates for a shift away from these scriptures and towards Buddha's Dhamma, which he believes offers a more equitable social structure. Thus, while both texts highlight the importance of education for the untouchables, Document 6 presents a broader critique of the caste system and suggests that educational reform is tied to a larger struggle against religious orthodoxy.",

    "generated_answer": "In Document 2, Dr. B.R. Ambedkar views Buddhism as a social code of moral conduct focused on avoiding evil, doing good, and purifying the mind, emphasizing equality among men. In contrast, in Document 5, he criticizes the sanctity and infallibility of scriptures, particularly Hindu scriptures (shastras), and argues that the problem of caste is not a social reform issue but a challenge to overthrow the authority of these scriptures due to their endorsement of caste system. Therefore, Ambedkar's view on religion in Document 5 is more critical and focused on challenging the power structure perpetuated by religious texts, whereas in Document 2, his view on religion is more positive and centered around the teachings of Buddhism as a solution for societal equality.",
