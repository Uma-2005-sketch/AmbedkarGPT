    "generated_answer": "The real remedy for the caste system, according to Dr. B.R. Ambedkar (as stated in Document 1), lies in destroying the belief in the sanctity of the shastras (scriptures). He suggests that one must either stop the practice of caste or stop believing in the shastras, and that overthrowing the authority of the shastras is key to resolving the problem of caste. He also emphasizes that social reform alone, without attacking the roots of the issue, would be like pruning a tree's leaves and branches without addressing its roots. His ideal society would be based on liberty, equality, and fraternity, which can only be realized through the abolition of caste. The Buddha's Dhamma is also seen as a potential solution, as it promotes avoiding evil, doing good, and purifying the mind, with man and his relationships at its center.",

However, unlike the shastras in Document 1, there is no explicit mention of a specific belief or doctrine being the enemy in Document 6. Instead, it's the power imbalance between the majority and minorities that is the problem.",

    "generated_answer": "In Document 2, Dr. B.R. Ambedkar views Buddhism as a social code of moral conduct aimed at creating a society of free and equal individuals. He considers it the only suitable religion for a world seeking equality. In contrast, in Document 5, he criticizes all religious scriptures, particularly those of Hinduism, arguing that they are the root cause of issues like the caste system and the Hindu-Muslim problem. According to him, believing in the sanctity of these scriptures prevents societal progress and reform, especially in overcoming issues like caste discrimination. Therefore, Ambedkar's view on religion differs significantly between Documents 2 and 5, with a positive stance towards Buddhism and a critical perspective towards Hindu religious scriptures.",
