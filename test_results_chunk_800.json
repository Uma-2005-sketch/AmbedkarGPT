    "generated_answer": "The real remedy for the caste system, according to Dr. B.R. Ambedkar (Document 1), is the destruction of the belief in the sanctity of the shastras, which necessitates a stand against scriptures. He suggests that either one should stop the practice of caste or stop believing in the shastras, and asserts that overthrowing the authority of the shastras is essential to eliminate the problem of caste. This approach is rooted in the idea that social reform must address the root cause rather than just its symptoms, and that the real enemy is the belief in the sanctity of the shastras.",
